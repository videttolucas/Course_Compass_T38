                <h1>What is Course Compass?</h1>
                <p>Course Compass aims to assist students with their enrollment process and academic progress tracking through its individual-oriented features
                     such as the ability to filter courses by various criteria such as professor ratings, personal and career interests, availability and meeting times,
                      and more. Users will be able to create an account to store relevant information pertaining to their academic life, and will be able to access
                       it at any time to resume planning their educational path. Their major, completed course history, and preferences will enable users to make
                        satisfactory decisions that align with their goals. Users will additionally be able to utilize features such as a calendar, to-do lists,
                         and graphical progress for visualization to stay on top of their responsibilities and maintain a healthy life as a student.
                         The product will largely be accomplished through the use of HTML, Vue.js, Python, Flask, and MySQL.

                <h1>Why Course Compass?</h1>
                <p>The inspiration for this product stems from the team’s personal struggles experienced while attempting to navigate the university’s official course enrollment site, aiming to aleve or outright eliminate any stress or confusion associated with doing so. 
                    Overall, the main goal Course Compass hopes to accomplish is to replace other methods of course selection and discovery with a more streamlined, simplified, and tailored experience that the user can then apply to their university’s official course registration process.
